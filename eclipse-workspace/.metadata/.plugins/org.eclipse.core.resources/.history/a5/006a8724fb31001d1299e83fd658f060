Loops in Java:

while
do while
for
enhanced for loop/for each loop/advanced for loop

for loop - when we know num of repetitions/iterations 
in advance

for (initialization, condition, increment/decrement ):
 code to check



while vs do while

while checks conditon first -> then executes code
do while executes code -> then check condition

while(boolean condition) {
code to repeat;
}

do{
code to repeat;
} while (boolean condition);
