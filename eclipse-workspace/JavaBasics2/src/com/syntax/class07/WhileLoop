while vs do while --> both loops executes while condition is true

while loop first CHECK condition --> if true -> executes code while first 
executes CODE --> THEN CHECKS CONDITION

for LOOP SYNTAX

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
code to be repeated;
}

// Hello 5 times

for (int i=1; i<=5; i++) {

 System.out.println("Hello");
 
}
when to use which loop:

when we know in advance how many times to repeat block of code --> USE FOR LOOP

when we do not know in advance how many times to reppeat block of code --> USE WHILE OR DO WHILE
