Type Casting:

Type Casting is converting one data type to another one.
For example we can convert short to a byte, a long to a float etc.
There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual
Implicit/widening/automatic type casting:

When java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happens when we assigning a smaller 
data type to a larger data type, because there is no data loss in this conversion.
 
 Explicit/narrowing/Manual Type casting:
 
 When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called
 Explicit/narrowing/Manual. It doesn't happen automatically we have to go to it explicitly.
 Manually.
 Why we should learn type casting?
 
 When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code from others to save time and 
 we might also need to convert the data types to make our code compatible with their code.
 
 What is the syntax for type casting?
 
 we use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for example if we want to convert 
 a long to an int this is how we can do it.
 long var1=250;
 int var2=(int)var1; // its Explicit/narrowing/Manual
 double var3=var2 // Implicit/widening/automatic
 
 float f=250.5F;
 double d=f // Implicit/widening/automatic
 
 If else conditions
 
 If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
 
 why we should learn about if else?
 Because when we are solving a real life problems like testing a website our program need to 
 make a lot of decisions.
 If (the given username and password matches) 
 {go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}
 
 What is the syntax for If else conditions
 
 boolean isHungry=true;
 
 if(isHungry) {
 System.out.println ("Please Eat something");
 } else {
 System.out.println ("Lets build some java program");
