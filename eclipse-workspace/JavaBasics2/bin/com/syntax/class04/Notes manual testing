class 2 MT
Why do we need to test?
To assure the quality of the software, we need to tewst it

stlc
requirement analisys - we analyse the requirements based on the smart criteria
test planning - test plan- test/qa lead/ manager

test case development-

testing hierarchy

Dev- where developers develop the app
Tst/qa - WHERE qA engineers perform testing
Staging/cert/qual/mr3 - where client testers pergorm testing/uat testing
production - it is live environment

Class 3 - Manual testing

Recap- -

STLC -
Test case development
Testing hierarchy - 

What we should do when we found a bug?

-verify if it is reproducible or not
-read the req to make sure that the bug you found is actually a bug

intermittent bugs (sometimes they appear sometimes not)

BUG LIVE CICLE

-How to report it?
-Collect as much information as possible:
exact steps we took to reproduce the bug
- browser, time, the environment, test data, logs, screenshots or screen recording

ALL THE BUGS WE SHOULD TO MENTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH:
-Severity (seriousness of the defect. level of that bug on functionality of app/system)
-Priority ( how soon the bug should be fixed)

Cucumber/ BDD / Gherkin ( behavioral, driven, development)

It allows you to write test cases/scenarios in simple plain english sentences

4 tags we need;
-Given - it represents pre condition
-When - to perform actions
-Then - expected results
-And - supporting tag

Scenario - Verify the login functionality for amazon
Given user is able to access amazon app in browser
When user enters username in username textfield
And user enters password in password textfield
Then user should be able to see login page

It is recommend and best practice to write cucumber scenarios in third person point of view
It is used to describe business rules

Homework - 
write 5 cucumber tast cases due by saturday 3 pm for amazon

in amazon

TYPES OF TESTING-
-functional ( to check the functionality of the app)
non-functional (backend testing behind the scenes)

Regression testing - testing the complete functionality/ all the test cases called regression testing

-unit testing (by dev)
-integration testing (by tester) - integrate new function to test
-regression test9ing ( all previous functionality plus new function ingrated)
-system testing (everything, bb, api, payment, server, 3d api, login/logout/dashboard)
-smoke testing

UAT
-integration testing
-performance testing
-508 Compliance testing
Ad hoc testing - exploratory testing, informal testing

Priject/Tes management tool

HP ALM
HP QC
Devops Azure
Rally
Trello
Jira - most popular
etc

why project management tool?

to see the project status
reporting purpose
user stories, sprint backlog, test cases, burn down


Cucumber - 
Acceptance criteria - 
DOR - Definition of ready - When scrum team gets the complete details about the user story and estimated it 
properly for taking up for the development

DOD - Definition of done - When development is done, testing is done, status of all test cases for this user story
is green and code is committed, then DOD is completed.

Agile ceremonies

Product backlog-
Sprint backlog -
You can not delete any item from Jira - bcz sometimes you need long history to track the project

Spring planning - once before spring (1-2 hours)
Spring scrum stand up - (15 min)
Spring grooming in a week happens  (1-2 hours) - do you need some details
Spring demo - (1-2 hours)
Sprint retrospective (1 hour)  - what we got from spring
