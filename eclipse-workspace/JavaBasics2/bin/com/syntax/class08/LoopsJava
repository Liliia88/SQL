Loops in Java:

while
do while
for
enhanced for loop/for each loop/advanced for loop

for loop - when we know num of repetitions/iterations 
in advance

for (initialization, condition, increment/decrement ):
 code to check



while vs do while

while checks conditon first -> then executes code
do while executes code -> then check condition

while(boolean condition) {
code to repeat;
}

do{
code to repeat;
} while (boolean condition);

nested loops - loop inside another loop

for (int i=1; i<3; i++) { --> outer loop
System.out.println("Hello");

for (int j=1; i<=3; j++) { --> nested loop
System.out.println("Bye");
}
}
