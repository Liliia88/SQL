&&, ||, !

why we should learn them?
- help us to reduce the num of if- conditions that we write in certain case.

what is the syntax?
- if (condition1 && condition2){
sout "hello";}

if (condition1){
  if(condition2){
  sout "Hello";
  }
  }Switch case:
  similar to if else if conditions.
  -less code, easier to read
