Type casting:
-type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another one.
We have 2 types of type casting:
- explicit/narrowing/manual
-implicit/widening/Automatic
When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called Explicit/narrowing/manual
and when we go from a smaller data type to a larger data type we call it Implicit/widening/
Automatic.
 bits
 
-byte(8)
-short(16)
-char (16)
-int (32)
-long (64)
-float(32)
-double (64)

byte->short,char->int->long->float->double

Why we need type casting?
When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types. When 
we are working with math sometime we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only interested 
in the non-decimal part.

What is the syntax?
Explicit/narrowing/Manual

If statements:
if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based on some condition 
and provided data.
-if condition
-if else condition
-nested if else condition

why we should learn about if else condition?
-when we are solving real life problems, like testing a web site our program needs to 
make a lot of decisions.

What is the syntax of if else conditions?
if condition

boolean rich=true;
if(rich)
{
System.out.println("Let's buy a Jet or Island");
